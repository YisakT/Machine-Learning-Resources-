A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S.\\nCensus Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population\\nof 600 to 3,000 people).\\n\\nA household is a group of people residing within a home. Since the average\\nnumber of rooms and bedrooms in this dataset are provided per household, these\\ncolumns may take surprisingly large values for block groups with few households\\nand many empty houses, such as vacation resorts.\\n\\nIt can be downloaded/loaded using the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing` function.\\n\\n.. topic:: References\\n\\n    - Pace, R.
